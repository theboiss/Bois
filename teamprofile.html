									        Mitchell having being a Protagonist, is understood to take the position of a leader and is capable of reaching out, and inspiring others to achieve their full potential. He has little to no fear to speak up and finds it easy to clearly communicate his thoughts with others. Mitchell also has an enthusiastic way to go about bringing the team back on track and to provide an effective way of rethinking the path to the end goal.
													<br>
													<br>
													He is a very visual learner and finds it more than helpful to write down, mock up and sketch what is spoken about in class to relay the material visually. Mitchell uses visual cues to assist not only his own but others understanding of the presented information.
									        Mitchell has an eye for creativity and design, and tends to prefer constructing the look of a product rather than the information the product contains. As much as creativity may be a positive, Mitchell can be overly obsessive with small details of the product.
									        <br>
									        <br>
									        Mitchell comes as a positive to any team by producing an enthusiastic group environment and by actively engaging all members to become involved with the project. He is capable of directing discussion to form meaningful and insightful leads and initiates thinking routines in group meetups to provide each member with the opportunity to reimagine the problem in new light.

									        <summary>Assignment Task</summary>
									        <br>
									        Though ‘Project Idea’ was an admirable task for Mitchell it was not fit for him due to him being the one to originally come up with the idea in Assignment 1. Wanting the team to bring an open mind to the project, he did not want to interfere and put limitations on where the app could go. Even though he still had a balanced input with suggestions he did not feel that it was best for him to speak on behalf of the group due to possibility of bias.
													<br>
													<br>
													Instead, due to his interest in Design and skills in HTML, Mitchell was responsible for all tasks that were to be put on the website such as the; formatting, team profile and tools.

									        <br>
													Danny having being an Entertainer, enjoys sharing his happiness with others, and is very generous with the time and energy that he puts into encouraging and assisting others within the group.  Danny has a unique wit which makes every group meetup fun to be at and is capable of defusing a once overly serious and stressful situation.
													<br>
													In order to truly understand the content that was just delivered, Danny needs to carry out physical activities which demonstrate the material rather than just listening through hour long lectures. Danny has excellent physical memory, meaning he needs to be able to touch and use his senses in order to truly accelerate his learning.
													<br>
													Danny does not feel fitted to the idea of creativity, and sometimes feels pressured when needing to produce original work. Non-artistic people tend to however have a valuable attribute which is the ability to enjoy something instead of overly obsess over it.
													<br>
													<br>
													Danny is crucial in crafting an enjoyable environment for the team and brings the entire team closer together through his ability to break the social barrier. In terms of his working style, Danny is incredibly selfless in the way that he provides a supportive hand to other members of the group to ensure they understand the concepts as much as he does. This is a quality that is more than crucial for group work situations as he ensures everyone is on the same page and not left behind.

									        <summary>Assignment Task</summary>

													Danny was an obvious choice for ‘IT Technologies’. Having described himself as ‘amazed by the capabilities machines possess’ in Assignment 1, Danny was able to explore the fascinating developments of the IT World and explore fields which he previously knew nothing about.
													<br>
													<br>

														David having being a Consul, is definitely a team player. He likes to lead his team to victory through his excellent management of time and admirable stride to meet his work obligations. David is very supportive towards his friends and loved ones, and puts in a consistent effort to make sure everyone is happy. David puts in the time to support and hear others and is not hesitant to put his own views forward and contradict opinions with his own.
														<br>
														David depends on both hearing and visually seeing work material. Meaning that a visual cue such as a presentation is preferred whilst explaining a concept to him so that David gets a full grasp on the understanding.
														<br>
														<br>
														David is vital when it comes to the management of the group as he is well equipped to eloquently delegate roles, and implement appropriate deadlines to ensure a complete and accurate final result. With David’s management and early deadline setting, the group will be protected by a safety net encase of submission issues and other error. It also gives the group time to all collectively look over the parts as a whole before the final submission is sent. On top of this David assists in building a supportive and friendly framework throughout the team with his warm and cooperative approach to the work.

														David worked on ‘Industry Data’ where he was able to build a familiarity on where the group member’s Ideal jobs sit in terms of demand in the real world and was able to normalise the skills required in the IT industry.

															<br>
															Luke having being a Logistician, will examine the logic and practicality of a solution. Integral as he is, Luke is dedicated to completing tasks with accuracy and patience until it is done to his best standards. He does not like to make assumptions and instead likes to examine all aspects of the issue before moving forward with his work.
															<br>
															Having being an Auditory Learner, Luke does not require visual, or tactile material in order to understand the content at hand and depends only on hearing and speaking the material through. It is beneficial to Luke to discuss key ideas and concepts one on one to enhance his learning.
															With the results of the third test, we can clearly see that Luke is eager to investigate and question certain concepts and ideas. This is a key attribute to have when the group is discussing the program as Luke will tend to raise objections to previously accepted ideas no matter whether everyone else in the team is in disagreement.
															<br>
															<br>
															Luke is a necessary member to any group as he is thorough and adamant in reviewing all small details of the assignment before he undergoes his tasks. Luke likes to clearly understand what other team members are discussing to the extent that he too could recall the information.
															<br>
															<br>
														</details>

													<details>
															<summary>Assignment Task</summary>
															<br>
															We thought it was only logical for Luke to relay our ‘Project Idea’ due his extensive ability to maintain a clear understanding of what we discuss in the group catch ups. In the case that there is a gap in writing out the Project Idea, we believed Luke would would have the best sense in making an appropriate and practical decision for the team.
															<br>
															<br>
															Luke also assisted Mitchell with the formatting of the website in times of uncertainty.

														George makes for a great addition to the group due to his desire to put himself in other people’s shoes and truly understand their raised ideas.

From this, George was able to build his understanding of the possible career paths available in IT, what their typical day consists of and the type of work that they regularly push through.
