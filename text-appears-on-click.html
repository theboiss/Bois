        <summary>Understanding their Test Results</summary>
        <br>
        Mitchell having being a Protagonist, is understood to take the position of a leader and is capable of reaching out, and inspiring others to achieve their full potential. He has little to no fear to speak up and finds it easy to clearly communicate his thoughts with others. Mitchell also has an enthusiastic way to go about bringing the team back on track and to provide an effective way of rethinking the path to the end goal.
        He is a very visual learner and finds it more than helpful to write down, mock up and sketch what is spoken about in class to relay the material visually. Mitchell uses visual cues to assist not only his own but others understanding of the presented information.
        Mitchell has an eye for creativity and design, and tends to prefer constructing the look of a product rather than the information the product contains. As much as creativity may be a positive, Mitchell can be overly obsessive with small details of the product.

        Mitchell comes as a positive to any team by producing an enthusiastic group environment and by actively engaging all members to become involved with the project. He is capable of directing discussion to form meaningful and insightful leads and initiates thinking routines in group meetups to provide each member with the opportunity to reimagine the problem in new light.

        <summary>Task</summary>
        <br>
        Though ‘Project Idea’ was an admirable task for Mitchell it was not fit for him due to him being the one to originally come up with the idea in Assignment 1. Wanting the team to bring an open mind to the project, he did not want to interfere and put limitations on where the app could go. Even though he still had a balanced input with suggestions he did not feel that it was best for him to speak on behalf of the group due to possibility of bias.
        <br>
        Instead, due to his interest in Design and skills in HTML, Mitchell was responsible for all tasks that were to be put on the website such as the; formatting, team profile and tools.
